In this project, we developed and evaluated a logistic regression model to analyze loan risk and determine borrower creditworthiness using historical data from a peer-to-peer lending platform. The data was first split into training and testing sets, with the target variable derived from the “loan_status” column, where a value of 0 indicated a healthy loan and 1 indicated a high-risk loan. We trained the logistic regression model using the training data, made predictions on the test set, and assessed the model's performance through accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. A detailed Credit Risk Analysis report was created to summarize the results, highlighting the model's ability to predict both healthy and high-risk loans.
